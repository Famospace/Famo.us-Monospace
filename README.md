### Famospace

Famospace is a reengineered and redesigned version of Monospace, a native iOS app by Daniel Lutz, that runs in the browser on any device.

Famospace is a unique puzzle game where players need to think in both 2 and 3 dimensions.

The goal is to collect a certain amount of grey cubes in every level. To do so, the player is given the ability to switch between 2 and 3-dimensional views of the game situation. Possibilities and solutions change depending on the players perspective.
